			In the movie, one of the characters named <u>Grand Master<br>Oogway</u>, who was an old wise turtle, said, 
		    <q><mark>Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a<br> mystery, but today is a gift. That is why it is called the present</q></mark>. 
			Being young, I<br>thought it was just funny/clever and would always rewind to hear it again. But as <br>I got older, 
			I started to realize that it actually made sense. What I got from it was <br>Don't worry about the past it already happened, focus on the future, 
			and you will <br> get through any situation.</font><br></br>
